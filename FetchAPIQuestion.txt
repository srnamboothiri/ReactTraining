Question : Is the Fetch API an ECMAScript feature ?

Answer: No. It's part of the Web platform API defined by the standards bodies WHATWG and W3C.
The various objects that implement the Fetch API are "host objects", which means the objects exposed to  
JavaScript that are provided by the application hosting the runtime (usually a browser).
